Today we live in an era where information is processed almost at the
 speed of light. Through computers, the technological revolution is 
drastically changing the way we live and communicate with one 
another. Terms such as "the Internet," which was unfamiliar just a 
few years ago, are very common today. With the help of computers you
 can send letters to, and receive letters from, loved ones within 
seconds. You no longer need to send a résumé by mail to apply for a
 job; in many cases you can simply submit your job application via 
the Internet. You can watch how stocks perform in real time, and 
instantly buy and sell them. Students regularly "surf" the Internet 
and use computers to design their classroom projects. They also use 
powerful word processing software to complete their term papers. 
Many people maintain and balance their checkbooks on computers.
